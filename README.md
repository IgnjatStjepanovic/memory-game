# memory-game
This is a simple memory game in HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. The logic is based on a tutorial from freecodecamp.org. 
I tweaked things like the size of the playfield, the logos and some of the game logic contained in JavaScript. Added a nice background animation with CSS.
Possible future features: A scoreboard, a timer or a victory animation when the whole board is cleared.
